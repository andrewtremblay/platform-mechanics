# platform-mechanics
An analysis / exploration tool for 2D platform movement. 

Hoping to find more definition behind the following common terms that describe most platformers: 
* "floaty", 
* "slippery/high momentum", 
* "bouncy", 
* "precise", 
* "fast/slow", 
* "optimized", 
* "dangerous", 
* "elegant", 
* "clunky", 
* etc.
